# ATM
Automated Teller Machine

In this project, I developed a Java program that simulates a real-life transaction at an ATM. Users can create an account and then perform various banking operations, including depositing money, withdrawing funds, transferring funds to other accounts, and viewing their transaction history.

What I learned:
>Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in working with classes and constructors, which helped me understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Java. I was also able to implement data structures and algorithms to support the functionality of the ATM simulation.

Future Improvements:
In future iterations of this project, I plan to enhance the account creation process. Currently, the PIN and name are hardcoded, which limits the realism of the simulation. To make it more authentic, I aim to rebuild the account creation page from scratch, allowing users to enter their desired PIN and name during the account setup process. This will provide a more comprehensive and interactive experience for users, further improving the realism and usability of the program.
